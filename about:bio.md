I'm an aspired moving image archivist. I completed my Master's degreee at NYU's Moving Imge Archiving and Preservation program in 2021, with my thesis on Mutoscope reels. I've worked with collections, made documentaries, edited short films, traveled across Europe alone, spent 230 hrs playing Witcher 3, and watched every film starring Keanu Reeeves.
