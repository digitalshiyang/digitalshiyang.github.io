I'm an aspired moving image archivist. I completed my Master's degree at NYU's Moving Image Archiving and Preservation program in 2021, with my thesis on Mutoscope reels. I've worked with collections, made documentaries, edited short films, traveled across Europe alone, spent 237 hrs playing Witcher 3, and watched every film starring Keanu Reeeves.
